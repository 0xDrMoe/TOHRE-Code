Note: Most likely an Impostor Killing/Concealing

Butcher kills (including passive kills) have multiple dead bodies on targets, making it impossible to accurately identify other dead body when reporting. Note: Due to the principle of implementation, the killed target has to repeatedly display the animation of being killed. This animation cannot be skipped and cannot participate in the meeting normally during this period. In addition, if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will revenges everyone in anger.
