I&#39;d like to address a few things before I move forward with this. <p>First of all, I have no hatred towards Loonie. I never have and never will, this is not something I do or feel within me. I&#39;m much more mature than that. I want to state that at this stage, Loonie refuses to distribute Canary and Dev Builds due to the leaks and hatred towards him. I, as well as many, MANY others have told him to either take a break from the mod, transfer ownership of the mod, and stay as a contributor, or leave completely and let it flourish on its own. He refuses to do so.</p><p>This all started from when Loonie acquired a phone from the Patreon money. This was valued at $200 CAD. He then proceeded to ask for Nitro for himself and his girlfriend. This was valued at an additional $20. I refused to give it to him, as this is going and making more funds liquidate from Patreon for his own personal gains. It then transpired into him removing my permissions, and talking poorly upon me until several members of the community (including staff) insisted on me getting them back, to which then he reinstated them.</p><p>Furthermore, he keeps making statements like &quot;Moe is abusive, and I don&#39;t trust him,&quot; which are empty comments, as I manage the Patreon, develop and <em>actively maintain</em> the Website. He&#39;s gone as far as saying &quot;I don&#39;t care about the Patreon,&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t care about the website.&quot; The thing is, he only stopped caring because <em>I</em> was the one doing them. This again, all stemmed from the above interaction. <em>Note, I have screenshots of all interactions and actions taken.</em></p><p>This then transpired to him doing what he is doing now. He is refusing to make a change in the better, so here&#39;s what I&#39;m outing him for.</p><blockquote><p>For the past few weeks, I&#39;ve just been treated the exact same way my mother did back in 2022 and early 2023. Abused, mistreated, and made my life a living nightmare. I had to shut my own fucking mother out of my life entirely. Moe&#39;s been acting the same fucking way towards me. I&#39;ve been terrified of this ass for weeks. - Loonie</p></blockquote><p>I have done NOTHING but be nice to this fucking dude and this is how he treats me. I have done good for the mod and you. I have ONLY gone against your actions and emotions because you are not caring about the mod OR its community. This is unfair and unjust. Calling me abusive because you don&#39;t like authority and someone rebutting you is immature, and the fact that you&#39;ve blocked me is significantly more inappropriate. Should you choose to delete this message, just know that your actions will be open to the public. Everyone will see what you are doing. There is a Google Document on all your actions and what you&#39;ve done. Because I am not a POS, I am not releasing that document. I am not wanting to take this to extreme measures, but this is what I&#39;m doing because you refuse to listen to me, your peers, your community and even your own partner. Sorry, Loonie. It&#39;s not MY fault, it&#39;s yours. Fix your reputation and step down.</p><p>What I am asking of you all is to vote. Do you want Loonie to stay as the owner of the mod, or should he relinquish his ownership and repository and step down?</p><p>Vote below.</p></p>',3),s=[n];function r(h,d){return t(),o("div",null,s)}const l=e(i,[["render",r],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
