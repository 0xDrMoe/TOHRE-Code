If you have no PC/Computer, you donâ€™t need to worry as, even if you don&#39;t have/can&#39;t get the mod, you can still join Host-Only mods (such as TOHE, TOH, PL, etc) as long as you have Among Us on any device! You can find the lobbies of these mods to join and play as long as you are on the right game version.</p><h2 id="you-have-been-kicked-by-room" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#you-have-been-kicked-by-room"><span>You have been kicked by room</span></a></h2>',4),u=s('<h2 id="you-have-been-kicked-by-among-us-official-anti-cheat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#you-have-been-kicked-by-among-us-official-anti-cheat"><span>You have been kicked by Among Us&#39; official anti-cheat</span></a></h2><p>The official Among Us anti-cheat system often treats mods as cheats and may kick you out of the game.

(Or for some roles, such as Crewpostor, you are an Impostor but your base is Engineer so that you can do Tasks to kill.) So for players who don&#39;t have the mod installed, you will see that you are an Impostor with no teammates. The initial team you are on is your role base. Please look at the bottom of your screen on the Role Reveal screen, or above your name in game to see what your actual role/team is.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-host-only-mods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-host-only-mods"><span>What are the Host-Only mods</span></a></h2><p>Host-Only mods are mods that are compatible with vanilla clients, meaning it only needs to be installed by the host and other players can still play without installing the mod.</p><h2 id="the-game-ends-inexplicably" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-game-ends-inexplicably"><span>The game ends inexplicably</span></a></h2><p>The game will end suddenly if there are an equal amount of Impostors alive to Non-Killing players (and the victory condition of a Neutral isn&#39;t met), the victory conditions of a Neutral is met, or the Crew is done all of their tasks. Some other possibilities may include:</p><ol><li><p>You have turned on the &quot;Ghost ignores tasks&quot; option and all alive players are finished tasks.</p></li><li><p>You have made the punishment of the &quot;Voting Mode&quot; option to be Suicide, which could have killing all players, leaving Impostors or Neutrals alive to take the win.</p></li><li><p>The host or a certain player made a fatal error, and the mod forcibly ended the game to prevent the game from being frozen.</p></li><li><p>None of these, make a #bug-report (Include Logs from /dump!)</p></li></ol><h2 id="just-after-the-start-it-shows-that-the-host-has-forced-the-end-of-the-game" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#just-after-the-start-it-shows-that-the-host-has-forced-the-end-of-the-game"><span>Just after the start, it shows that the host has forced the end of the game</span></a></h2><p>It&#39;s a protection mechanism, just ignore it and keep playing. The reason this occurs is because, there is a bug with Host-Only mods that fails to assign roles. When the bug occurs in the original Town of Host, the host will not be able to see the start button, and other players will be loaded with an infinite black screen. In this case, everyone can only exit the game. In Town of Host: Enhanced, in order to avoid this situation, it will automatically detect whether other players are stuck in loading, and if detected, the game will be automatically terminated to prevent everyone from being stuck.</p><h2 id="most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-i-can-interact-with-the-gui-and-the-sound-can-still-be-heard" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-i-can-interact-with-the-gui-and-the-sound-can-still-be-heard"><span>Most of the screen is black, but I can interact with the GUI and the sound can still be heard</span></a></h2><p>This is caused by the failure of the client to assign roles, and it is also one of the unavoidable problems of Host-Only mods. Unfortunately, when this happens, you have to quit the game or just wait until the game ends.</p><h2 id="there-are-a-lot-of-duplicate-roles-in-the-game" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#there-are-a-lot-of-duplicate-roles-in-the-game"><span>There are a lot of duplicate roles in the game</span></a></h2><p>This most likely isn&#39;t a bug, please make sure the duplicated role has a Maximum of 1 rather than 2-15.</p><h2 id="i-got-vanilla-roles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-got-vanilla-roles"><span>I got vanilla roles</span></a></h2><p>There are a few posibilities</p>',36),m=e("li",null,[e("p",null,'You might need to turn on the "Disable vanilla roles" option.')],-1),p=e("li",null,[e("p",null,"You may need to enable more roles or allow more players to be the same role.")],-1),g=e("li",null,[e("p",null,"Eraser might've erased your role, resetting you to your base role (Impostor/Shapeshifter/Crewmate/Engineer/Scientist are all Base Roles (Base Role =/= Team/Role))")],-1),b=s('<h2 id="the-game-never-ends" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-game-never-ends"><span>The game never ends</span></a></h2><p>There are a few possibilities,</p><ol><li><p>You have enabled &quot;No Game End&quot; in settings.
