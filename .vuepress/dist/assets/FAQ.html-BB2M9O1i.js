(Or for some roles, such as Crewpostor, you are an Impostor but your base is Engineer so that you can do Tasks to kill.) So for players who don&#39;t have the mod installed, you will see that you are an Impostor with no teammates. The initial team you are on is your role base. Please look at the bottom of your screen on the Role Reveal screen, or above your name in game to see what your actual role/team is.</p><h2 id="what-are-host-only-mods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-host-only-mods"><span>What are Host-Only mods?</span></a></h2><p>Host-Only mods are mods that are compatible with vanilla clients, meaning it only needs to be installed by the host and other players can still play without installing the mod.</p><h2 id="why-does-the-game-end-inexplicably" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-the-game-end-inexplicably"><span>Why does the game end inexplicably?</span></a></h2><p>The game will end suddenly if there are an equal amount of Impostors alive to Non-Killing players (and the victory condition of a Neutral isn&#39;t met), the victory conditions of a Neutral is met, or the Crew is done all of their tasks. Some other possibilities may include:</p><ol><li><p>You have turned on the &quot;Ghost ignores tasks&quot; option and all alive players are finished tasks.</p></li><li><p>You have made the punishment of the &quot;Voting Mode&quot; option to be Suicide, which could have killing all players, leaving Impostors or Neutrals alive to take the win.</p></li><li><p>The host or a certain player made a fatal error, and the mod forcibly ended the game to prevent the game from being frozen.</p></li><li><p>None of these, make a #bug-report (Include Logs from /dump!)</p></li></ol><h2 id="just-after-the-start-it-shows-that-the-host-has-forced-the-end-of-the-game-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#just-after-the-start-it-shows-that-the-host-has-forced-the-end-of-the-game-why"><span>Just after the start, it shows that the host has forced the end of the game, why?</span></a></h2><p>It&#39;s a protection mechanism, just ignore it and keep playing. The reason this occurs is because, there is a bug with Host-Only mods that fails to assign roles. When the bug occurs in the original Town of Host, the host will not be able to see the start button, and other players will be loaded with an infinite black screen. In this case, everyone can only exit the game. In Town of Host: Enhanced, in order to avoid this situation, it will automatically detect whether other players are stuck in loading, and if detected, the game will be automatically terminated to prevent everyone from being stuck.</p><h2 id="most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-i-can-interact-with-the-gui-and-the-sound-can-still-be-heard-what-happened" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-i-can-interact-with-the-gui-and-the-sound-can-still-be-heard-what-happened"><span>Most of the screen is black, but I can interact with the GUI and the sound can still be heard, what happened?</span></a></h2><p>This is caused by the failure of the client to assign roles, and it is also one of the unavoidable problems of Host-Only mods.
