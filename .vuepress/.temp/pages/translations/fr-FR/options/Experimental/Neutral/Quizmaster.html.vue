<font size=4em>Experimental Reason: requires testing</font><br><p>Note: Most likely a Neutral Chaos</p>
<p>As the Quizmaster, you can mark a player using your kill button. In the next meeting, the marked player will &quot;?!&quot; next to their name. If the player answers a question wrongly, or doesn't answer, they will die. If the Quizmaster was killed/ejected in the same meeting, the player will live.<br>
The Quizmaster cannot mark multiple people in the same round</p>
