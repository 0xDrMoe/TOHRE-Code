<hr>
<p>As the Mastermind, you can use your kill button on a player once to manipulate them. This does nothing if the target doesn't have a kill button. But if the target has a kill button of any time, they'll be told after a delay that they were manipulated and they must kill someone in a limited time to survive. If the time limit expires or a meeting gets called before killing someone, they die.<br>
Double click on someone to kill them normally.</p>
