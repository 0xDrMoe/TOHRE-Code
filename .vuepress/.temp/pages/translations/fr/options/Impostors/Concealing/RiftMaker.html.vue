<p>As Rift Maker you can shapeshift to create a rift. You can teleport from one rift to another by touching the area where the rift was created. Trying to vent will kick you out and all the rifts will be destroyed.<br><br></p>
<p>Note: Up to two rifts can be placed at a time, if you try to place a third, it removes the first one.</p>
