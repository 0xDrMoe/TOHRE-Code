<p>Keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases page<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> for new stable releases. If a new version is released, all you'll usually need to do is repeat steps 1-2 above in either guide, unzipping into the same folder where you already have it installed, and letting it overwrite/replace the old files.<br>
If it says it requires a newer version of Among Us, repeat steps 3-5 as well after making sure your base game is up to date.<br>
In some cases, the <b>Latest</b>&gt; TOHE Builds are Beta or Alpha Builds. Follow the first step in the below guide to get Alpha/Beta Builds. Stable builds will always be the latest, unless a Beta build has a higher version number, unless a Alpha build has a higher version number than the Beta version.<br>
(Ex: 1.6.0 Stable -&gt; 2.0.0 Alpha 2 -&gt; 2.0.0 Beta 1 -&gt; 2.0.0 Stable)</p>
