<p>The Arsonist can douse by clicking the kill button on the player and following them for a few seconds. When the dousing starts and its successful, a shield-animation will be displayed as a reminder (only visible to themselves). When all surviving players have been doused by the Arsonist, the Arsonist can vent to start the fire and win alone.</p>
<p>If the player name shows „Äå‚ñ≥„Äç, that means they are being doused.</p>
<p>if the player name shows „Äå‚ñ≤„Äç, it means they have been completely doused.</p>
