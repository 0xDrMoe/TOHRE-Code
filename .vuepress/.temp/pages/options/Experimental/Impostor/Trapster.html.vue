<hr>
<p>The Trapster will put a trap on the victim's body after killing, and the player who reports the dead body with the Trapster will be killed immediately (the body doesn't get reported), and the player who is killed will also have the effect of Trapsters, and so on. But as a price, the Trapster will die immediately after making a kill. <br>
<br>Note: The Trapster doesn't have a Trapster effect on their own dead body.</p>
