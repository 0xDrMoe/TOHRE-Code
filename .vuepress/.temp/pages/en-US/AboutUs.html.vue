<p>I like coding for fun, and started off modifying Town of Host: The Other Roles. Released it a few months later under the name &quot;Town of Host Plus&quot;.</p>
<p>Then I discovered Town of Host Edited, and moved on to it. Then I decided to modify that as well when I was bored. Many roles in TOHE now (such as Poisoner and Marshall) were from that stage.</p>
<p>Then came the day Karpe decided to discontinue TOHE and quit the modding, to where I stepped in to continue the man's work and keep the mod's glory alive.</p>
<p>Thus, Town of Host Edited: Restored was born.</p>

<p>I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in High School, and I've been coding for 6 years. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French and Arabic verbally! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship, but I stumbled upon TOHE and I loved it. I decided to help out with the mod, and I'm currently the website developer.</p>
<p>I specialize in HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python and C++. I graduated from College with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, fousing on Cybersecurity. and I'm working towards that goal.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy the mod, and I hope to see you on Discord!</p>
