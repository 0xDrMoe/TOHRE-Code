<p>You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. If you want to use a preset, make sure the file is renamed to <code v-pre>Options.json</code> before using it, if it isn't already. (If you do not have <code v-pre>File name extensions</code> marked on the <code v-pre>View</code> Tab, you only need to rename it to <code v-pre>Options</code>.)</p>
<p>Note: You have to put the file in the following directory: <code v-pre>.\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData</code> for it to work. (If you cannot locate <code v-pre>TOHE-DATA\SaveData</code>, try enabling <code v-pre>Hidden items</code> on the <code v-pre>View</code> Tab!)</p>
<p>You can submit your own preset to be featured by joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/TOHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOHE Discord<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, heading to #website-feedback, and creating a forum post with the Preset tag.
