<p>You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. If you want to use a preset, make sure the file is renamed to <code v-pre>Options.json</code> before using it, if it isn't already. (If you do not have <code v-pre>File name extensions</code> marked on the <code v-pre>View</code> Tab, you only need to rename it to <code v-pre>Options</code>.)</p>
<p>Note: You have to put the file in the following directory: <code v-pre>.\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData</code> for it to work. (If you cannot locate <code v-pre>TOHE-DATA\SaveData</code>, try enabling <code v-pre>Hidden items</code> on the <code v-pre>View</code> Tab!)</p>
<p>You can submit your own preset to be featured by joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/ten" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Server<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, heading to #website-feedback, and creating a forum post with the Preset tag.
Below are some member submitted presets:
NOTE: If you download a preset that is from a version newer than that one which you are running on, it will still work, but any settings in the preset you downloaded that aren't already in the version you are on will be ignored.</p>
