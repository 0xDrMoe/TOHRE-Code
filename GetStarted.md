## MANUAL INSTALLATION
Installation requires that you own a PC version of Among Us on Steam, Epic, or Itch. 

1. Download the latest full Release of TOHRE [here](https://github.com/Loonie-Toons/TownOfHost-ReEdited/releases). You only need the main zip such as "TOHE.v2.5.0.zip", not the source code files.

2. Once the download is complete, unzip it into the location of your choice. Example: C:\TOHRE

3. Locate your AmongUs install. For example, if you own the game on Steam, you can find this by right clicking on the game in your library, selecting "Manage", and finally selecting "Browse local files."

4. Select all of the files in your AmongUs installation and copy them to the folder that now has the files from the TOHRE release. The folder should now look something like this:

5. Within the TOHRE folder, run Among Us.exe. The first time running it may take some time while the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHRE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.
#### You have now installed TOHRE! All that remains is to start up a private lobby and customize your settings.

## Update
Keep an eye on the [releases page](https://github.com/Loonie-Toons/TownOfHost-ReEdited/releases) for new releases. If a new version is released, all you'll usually need to do is repeat steps 1-2 above, unzipping into the same folder where you already have it installed and letting it overwrite. If it says it requires a newer version of Among Us, repeat steps 3-5 as well after making sure your base game is up to date.
