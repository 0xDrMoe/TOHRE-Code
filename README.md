<p>To all the amazing players that keep TOHE in their hearts,</p>
<p>We have taken over TOHE to keep the mod maintained. Loonie will be prioritizing development, while Moe
will be maintaining the website.</p>
<p>We play Among Us a fair amount, so we will do our best to keep it all updated and viable to play with
each update that comes</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that we are still in the Canary (Beta) phase, so not everything is optimized/stable.
We ask for your patience while we continue to make TOHE <i>Restored</i></p>
<p>Ultimately, we thank you for your patience while we continue to update the mod. TOHE will be remembered
by KARPED1EM with the new name TOHE-R.</p>
