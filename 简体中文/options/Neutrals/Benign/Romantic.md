浪漫者可以使用击杀键去选择一名恋人(他可以在游戏中的任何时刻选择) Once they've picked their partner, they can use their kill button to give their partner a temporary shield which protects them from attacks. If their lover partner dies, the Romantic's role will change according to the following conditions:<br>

1. If their partner was an Impostor, the Romantic becomes the Refugee<br>
2. If their partner was a Neutral Killer, then they become Ruthless Romantic.<br>
3. If their partner was a Crewmate or a non-killing neutral, the Romantic becomes the Vengeful Romantic.<br><br>

The Romantic wins with the winning team if their partner wins.<br>
Note : If your role changes your win condition will be changed accordingly
