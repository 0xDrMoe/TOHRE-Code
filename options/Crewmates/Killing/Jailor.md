As the Jailor, use your kill button to lock a player in jail. During the next meeting, the jailed player cannot vote or be voted (vote count will be 0).<br>
The Jailor may choose to execute the prisoner by voting them. If the Jailor executes an innocent player, the Jailor loses the ability to execute for the rest of the game.<br>
The Jailor has limited executions.<br><br>
Note: Jailed players cannot be guessed or judged and jailed players can only guess Jailor.
