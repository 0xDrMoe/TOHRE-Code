The Judicator can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting. 

If it is correct, the target dies, and if it is wrong, the Judicator dies. 

The guessing command is `/bt [player ID] [Role]`

You can see the ID of player‚Äôs next to their name, or by typing `/id`

PS: You don‚Äôt need to worry about this if you have a TOHE Modded Client, as it includes a built-in Guesser GUI on Player Nameplates)
