As the Wraith, you can use vents to temporarily go invisible.<br>
Due to vents toggling your ability to go invisible, you cannot vent.<br>
Trying to vent while invisible will cause you to become visible again.<br>
Even when on cooldown, you cannot vent.<br><br>
Kill everyone to win.
* Vanish Cooldown
