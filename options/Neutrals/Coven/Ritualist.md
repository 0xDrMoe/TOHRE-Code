As the Ritualist, you are the Coven's guesser.<br>
Guess roles in meetings to kill.<br>
Guessing incorrectly kills you instead.<br><br>
The guessing command is: `/bt [player id] [role]`<br>
You can see the player's id before the player's name, or use the `/id` command to view the id of all players.
