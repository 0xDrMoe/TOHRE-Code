The Arsonist can douse by clicking the kill button on the player and following them for a few seconds. When the dousing starts and its successful, a shield-animation will be displayed as a reminder (only visible to themselves). When all surviving players have been doused by the Arsonist, the Arsonist can vent to start the fire and win alone.

If the player name shows 「△」, that means they are being doused.

if the player name shows 「▲」, it means they have been completely doused.
