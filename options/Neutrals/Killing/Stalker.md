The Stalker can kill anyone, and every kill will immediately cause electricity sabotage (if electricity is already sabotaged, nothing will happen). Stalker cannot vent. If the <font color=red>Impostor</font> wins while the Stalker is alive or the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> wins by killing the <font color=red>Impostors</font> (according to the host's setting, the Stalker may also win when the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> wins by killing the Neutrals), then the Stalker win alone.
* Kill Cooldown
  * Set how long a Stalker has to wait to kill.
* Has <font color=red>Impostor</font> Vision
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Stalker has the same vision as an Impostor
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Stalker has default vision
* When <font color=#8cffff>Crewmates</font> win by killing a <font color=#7f8c8d>Neutral</font> player, they can snatch the victory
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Stalker can steal a <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> Victory if the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmates</font> win by killing/voting a <font color=#7f8c8d>Neutral</font> player
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Stalker will not steal the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> victory
* Snatches Victory
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Stalker can steal the win from anyone as long as the Stalker is alive
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Stalker will not steal the win from anyone
