As the Vulture, you do not report bodies normally.<br>
Instead, reporting a body causes you to eat it, making it unreportable.<br>
Eat enough bodies to win!

  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Vulture will receive arrows pointing to dead bodies (like a Mortician would)
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Vulture will not receive any arrows
* Bodies needed to win
  * Set the Amount of Bodies a Vulture needs to Eat to Win
* Can Vent
