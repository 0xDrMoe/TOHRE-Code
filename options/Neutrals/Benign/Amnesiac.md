If the target was an Impostor, you'll become a Refugee.<br>
If the target was a Crewmate, you'll become a Sheriff.<br>
If the target was a passive neutral or a neutral killer not specified, you'll become the role defined in the settings.<br>
If the target was a neutral killer of a select few, you'll become the role they are.<br>
