The Hater will not be lovers or Neptune. The Hater has unlimited killing ability without cooling down. At the same time, the keen observation ability of the Hater makes him have the <font color=red>Impostor</font> vision by default. The Hater can only kill Lovers and Neptune. Hater kills itself instantly if it kills the wrong target. At the end of the game, if there are no Lovers and Neptune alive and the Hater has killed Lovers or Neptune at least once, the Neptune wins with winning team.
