The Hater will not be Lovers. The Hater has unlimited killing ability without cooling down. At the same time, the keen observation ability of the Hater makes him have the <font color=red>Impostor</font> vision by default. The Hater can only kill Lovers. Hater kills itself instantly if it kills the wrong target. At the end of the game, if there are no Lovers alive and the Hater has killed at least one Lover, the Hater wins with winning team.
