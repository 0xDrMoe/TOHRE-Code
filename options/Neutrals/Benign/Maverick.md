You can kill like a Serial Killer, and you win with the winning team rather than alone. If you die, you lose.
* Kill Cooldown
  * Set how long a Maverick needs to wait to use their kill
* Can Vent
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Maverick can Vent
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Maverick cannot Vent
* Has <font color=red>Impostor</font> Vision
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Maverick has the same vision as an Impostor
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Maverick has default vision
