As Shaman you can use your kill button to select s voodoo doll once every round. All the interactions with you using kill button will be deflected to the voodoo doll and the voodoo doll will destroy.<br><br>
Since Witch uses magic too, the effect of the voodoo doll will be nullified (voodoo doll won't be destroyed though) and will take place on Shaman itself.<br><br>
If you survive till the end, you win with the winning team.
* Max
