As the Quizmaster, you can mark a player using your kill button. In the next meeting, the marked player will "?!" next to their name. If the player answers a question wrongly, or doesn't answer, they will die. If the Quizmaster was killed/ejected in the same meeting, the player will live.<br>
The Quizmaster cannot mark multiple people in the same round
