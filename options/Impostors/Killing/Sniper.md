You can shoot players from far away. You have to shapeshift twice to make a successful snipe. Imagine an Arrow from your Shapeshift location to your Unshift location, thatâ€™s the way the bullet will go. The snipe kills the first person in its path. You cannot kill normally until you use up all of your ammo.
* Max
  * Set the Maximum amount of Snipers that can be in a match
* Ammo
  * Set how much Ammo the Sniper gets in a match
* Precise Shooting: 
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: this makes Sniper shooting more precise. 
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: shooting will be less lenient
* Aim Assist
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: aiming will be easier
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: you will receive no help for aiming as Sniper
    * One Shot Assist
      * <font color=green>ON</font>: your First Shot will always hit the closest player
      * <font color=red>OFF</font>: your first shot will perform as usual
* Sniper can kill with bullets remaining
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Sniper can kill like default <font color=red>Impostors</font> even if they still havenâ€™t used up all of their bullets
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Sniper will work as default
