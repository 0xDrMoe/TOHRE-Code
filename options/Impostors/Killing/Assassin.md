The Assassin can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting. 

If it is correct, the target dies, and if it is wrong, the Assassin dies. 

The guessing command is `/bt [player ID] [Role]`.<br>
You can see the ID of player’s next to their name, or by typing `/id`<br>
Note: You don’t need to worry about this if you have a TOHE Modded Client, as it includes a built-in Guesser GUI on Player Nameplates)
