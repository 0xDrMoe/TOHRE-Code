The killing method of the Hangman during the Shapeshifting is Strangling. Strangling ignores any status of the target. Such as the shield of a Medic, the skills of a Bodyguard or Superstar. The Strangled player will not leave a dead body, nor will it trigger any of its skills. For example, Veteran kills back, Luckey stays alive, etc. The Seer will not be alerted.
