1. Download the latest full Release of TOHE in `#mod-release` or [here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases). You only need the main zip such as "`TOHE.v1.0.0.zip`", not the source code files.

2. Once the download is complete, unzip it into a new empty folder like on desktop.

5. Within the TOHE folder, run `Among Us.exe`. The first time running it may take some time while the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.

6. `(Optional)` Right click your `Among Us.exe` and click '`Create shortcut`'. Move your new shortcut to wherever you can easily access it, such as your Desktop!
#### You have now installed Town of Host: Enhanced! All that remains is to start up a private lobby and customize your settings.

<summary><b><font color=#d395b4>New Releases</font></b></summary>

Keep an eye on the [releases page](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases) for new stable releases. If a new version is released, all you'll usually need to do is repeat steps 1-2 above in either guide, unzipping into the same folder where you already have it installed, and letting it overwrite/replace the old files.<br>
If it says it requires a newer version of Among Us, repeat steps 3-5 as well after making sure your base game is up to date.<br>
In some cases, the <b>Latest</b>> TOHE Builds are Canary or Alpha Builds. Follow the first step in the below guide to get Alpha/Canary Builds. Stable builds will always be the latest, unless a Canary build has a higher version number, unless a Alpha build has a higher version number than the Canary version.<br>
(Ex: 1.6.0 Stable -> 2.0.0 Alpha 2 -> 2.0.0 Canary 1 -> 2.0.0 Stable)
