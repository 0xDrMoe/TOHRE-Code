<summary><b><font color=#d395b4>Install TOHE for</font> <font color=#14356a>Steam</font></b></summary>

Notice: You can follow the installation video [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyD75caFQ0) if you want visuals with steps. However, the below steps work just fine.

1. Download the latest full Release of TOHE in `#mod-release` or [here](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases). You only need the main zip such as "`TOHE.v1.0.0.zip`", not the source code files. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE `-MS` FILE, IT WILL NOT WORK!

2. Once the download is complete, unzip it into a new empty folder like on desktop.

3. Locate your AmongUs install. For example, if you own the game on Steam, you can find this by right clicking on the game in your library, selecting "Manage", and finally selecting "Browse local files."<br>

4. Select all of the files in your Among Us installation and copy them to the folder that now has the files from the TOHE release. The folder should now look something like this:<br>
![image](./images/ResultFolder.png)

5. Within the TOHE folder, run `Among Us.exe`. The first time running it may take some time while the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.

6. `(Optional)` Right click your `Among Us.exe` and click '`Create shortcut`'. Move your new shortcut to wherever you can easily access it, such as your Desktop!
#### You have now installed Town of Host: Enhanced! All that remains is to start up a private lobby and customize your settings.

5. Within the Among Us folder, run `EpicGamesStarter.exe` ([Download Here](https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesStarter/releases/tag/1.0.2) & Follow instructions on page.) The first time running it may take some time while installing a prerequisite and the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen or a console window, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.

6. Add the folder you put the mod and among us files in as a exclusion for any antivirus you have and windows defender.

<summary><b><font color=#d395b4>Install TOHE for</font> <font color=#3004fc>Mod Manager</font></b></summary>

1. Download the [Mod Manager 7](https://goodloss.fr/mm/) installer.

2. Once the download is complete, open the installer and click install. You can change the destination if you want, but that's not required. Once Mod Manager is installed, close the installer (delete it if you'd like) and open Mod Manager (There should be an icon on your desktop, if not then check around in AppData).

3. `(Notice)` If you get a notification like this upon opening Mod Manager, re-install Among Us fully.<br>

<summary><b><font color=#d395b4>New Releases</font></b></summary>

Keep an eye on the [releases page](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases) for new stable releases. If a new version is released, all you'll usually need to do is repeat steps 1-2 above in either guide, unzipping into the same folder where you already have it installed, and letting it overwrite/replace the old files.<br>
If it says it requires a newer version of Among Us, repeat steps 3-5 as well after making sure your base game is up to date.<br>
In some cases, the <b>Latest</b> TOHE Builds are Beta or Alpha Builds. Follow the first step in the below guide to get Alpha/Beta Builds. Stable builds will always be the latest, unless a Beta build has a higher version number, unless a Alpha build has a higher version number than the Beta version.<br>
(Ex: 1.6.0 Stable -> 2.0.0 Alpha 2 -> 2.0.0 Beta 1 -> 2.0.0 Stable)
