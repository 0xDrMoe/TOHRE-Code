* By [**Pyro**](https://sites.google.com/view/pyro0tv)<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Updated to v2.0.0 Canary 4<br>
\+ Have a good day!<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: The Upcoming Vanilla Roles are added to respective categories, BUT are not at all finished, this is due to the fact that they aren't in base game, and they are not in TOHE yet either. (Phantom + Noisemaker + Tracker, TOHE Tracker + TOHE Phantom are still there (not to be confused with Vanilla Among Us roles))<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of Advanced.md, as well as FAQ.md.<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Added Presets.md - Redid the Presets part of Advanced.md, and decided that Presets should be compiled elsewhere as to not clutter Advanced. (Added Marg's Presets, and removed 2 Out of Date Presets (WitchCraft/Moe's Presets which will not work anymore)).<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Renamed GetStarted.md to Install.md (also fixed linking).<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Added some more bios into AboutUs.md.<br>
= <font color=#1376f0><b>BUG FIXES</b></font>: Many small formatting, linking, and spelling fixes + a few small tweaks.<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Chinese & French Translations are still in the works. (Sorry Translators, but at least they have their own folder(s) now!)<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may realize that there are 3 results of roles if you use the built-in search bar. This is because you are getting a copy for every instance (Currently, French & Chinese) that is not yet translated. (An example being Reverie, even though <i>most</i> roles will display 3 results.)<br>
![image](./images/SearchReverie3BUG.png)<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may also find older roles from French/Chinese results, such as Luckey from the Chinese instance, as they are not up-to-date, nor translated entirely.<br>

= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Role Counts/Amounts are not remotely close to correct, if someone would like to do the math because Pyro is lazy, PLEASE DO! :D thanks!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: If there are any other issues, open a forum in #website-feedback! Thank you! - Pyro<br>
