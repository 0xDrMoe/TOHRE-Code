* By [**Pyro**](https://sites.google.com/view/notpyro404)<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Updated to v2.0.0<br>
\+ Have a good day!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: If there are any other issues, or you simply have feedback, open a forum in `#website-feedback`! Thank you!<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Added `Other` as a Tab for Add-ons as it's nicer to keep all addons in the same group (I'm not adding them to Game Modifiers, that's ugly).<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Added `Translations.md` (Instead of cluttering `Resources.md` with future Translation Submissions, Translations will be listed here.) Currently has no entries, nor submissions.<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Tab Favicon (Thanks Theta!)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: All Commands + Hot-Keys are updated and finally listed. (Minus a few variants. However, variants like `/r` & `/role` were included.)<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Dev Builds are now listed as Alpha Builds, this is due to a name change coming soon in the future.<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Role Counts/Amounts are finally corrected, thanks Drakos for doing the numbers! No idea what `[None] = Count: 13` still means though.<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: `zh-CN` and `fr` are fully up-to-date with Main (en-US), but not translated, meaning Simplified Chinese & French Translations are still in the works, sorry!<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may realize that there are 3 results of roles if you use the built-in search bar. This is because you are getting a copy for every instance (Currently, `fr` & `zh-CN`) that is not yet translated. (An example being Reverie, even though <i>most</i> roles will display 3 results.)<br>
