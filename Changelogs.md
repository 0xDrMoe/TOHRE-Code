= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Resources.md` (Includes more Resources to look through, such as Commands/HotKeys like before, as well as Death Reasons + why they occur, and more.)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `FAQ.md` (Questions are now sorted in drop-down boxes.)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Install.md` (Now includes both Steam + Epic guides, and has been straightened up.)<br>

= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Changelogs.md` again. (Now utilizes Dropdown boxes as to not clutter the page, allowing for people to look at the changelogs they care about.)
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Relating to the above changes, `Stable.md`, `Canary.md`, & `Dev.md` will be overhauled to utilize dropdown boxes too, but thats a lot more work.
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Fixing Spacing (hopefully) for `FAQ.md`, as well as `Install.md` & `Resources.md`.
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Added `Presets.md` (Instead of cluttering `Resources.md` with future Preset Submissions, Presets will be listed here. Added Marg's Preset & removed 2 out of date Presets (WitchCraft & Moe's Presets which used the old system).<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: More Bios added to `AboutUs.md`. (Still not 100% Complete as we are still missing the Bios of a few Contributors. You can see which as they'll have `(Placeholder Bio)` in the place of their Bio.<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Role Counts/Amounts are finally corrected, thanks Drakos for doing the numbers! No idea what `[None] = Count: 13` still means though.<br>

= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may realize that there are 3 results of roles if you use the built-in search bar. This is because you are getting a copy for every instance (Currently, `fr` & `zh-CN`) that is not yet translated. (An example being Reverie, even though <i>most</i> roles will display 3 results.)<br>
![image](./images/SearchReverie3BUG.png)<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may also find older roles from French/Simplified Chinese results, such as Luckey from the `zh-CN` instance, as they are not up-to-date, nor translated entirely. (Luckey isn't in the `zh-CN` instance anymore, but the same issue can occur with other roles.)<br>
![image](./images/SearchLuckeyBUG.png)<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Once Translations start being worked on, Translators may use this Site Changelog section to write out changelogs for their Translated parts of the Site. They may want to differenciate it, which they may if they write their own header things.<br>
