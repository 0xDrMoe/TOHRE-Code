= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Updated to v2.1.0 Alpha 4<br>
\+ Have a good day!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: If there are any other issues, or you simply have feedback, open a forum in `#website-feedback`! Thank you!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Soul Collector & Berserker work differently in 2.1.0 Alpha 2 than they do in 2.0.2 Stable Release.<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Added `Other` as a Tab for Add-ons as it's nicer to keep all addons in the same group (I'm not adding them to Game Modifiers, that's ugly).<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Added `Translations.md` (Instead of cluttering `Resources.md` with future Translation Submissions, Translations will be listed here.) Currently has no entries, nor submissions.<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Tab Favicon (Thanks Theta!)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: All Commands + Hot-Keys are updated and finally listed. (Minus a few variants. However, variants like `/r` & `/role` were included.)<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Dev Builds are now listed as Alpha Builds, this is due to a name change coming soon in the future.<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Canary Builds are now listed as Beta Builds, this is due to a name change coming soon in the future.<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Role Counts/Amounts are finally corrected, thanks Drakos for doing the numbers! No idea what `[None] = Count: 13` still means though. Some Role Counts may be out of date, but I'm merely too lazy to figure it out (Roles changed factions + sub-factions yes very confusing I know (not really just lazy))<br>
