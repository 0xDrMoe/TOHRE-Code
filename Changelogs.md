* By [**Pyro**](https://sites.google.com/view/pyro0tv)<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Updated to v2.0.0 Dev 23<br>
\+ Have a good day!<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of Advanced.md, as well as FAQ.md.<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Added Presets.md - Redid the Presets part of Advanced.md, and decided that Presets should be compiled elsewhere as to not clutter Advanced. (Added Marg's Presets, and removed 2 Out of Date Presets (WitchCraft/Moe's Presets which will not work anymore)).<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Renamed GetStarted.md to Install.md (also fixed linking).<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: Added some more bios into AboutUs.md.<br>
= <font color=#1376f0><b>BUG FIXE</b></font>: Many small formatting, linking, and spelling fixes + a few small tweaks.<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Chinese & French Translations are still in the works. (Sorry Translators, but at least they have their own folder(s) now!)<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may realize that there are 3 results of roles if you use the built-in search bar. This is because you are getting a copy for every instance (Currently, French & Chinese) that is not yet translated. (An example being Reverie, even though <i>most</i> roles will display 3 results.)<br>

= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may also find older roles from French/Chinese results, such as Luckey from the Chinese instance, as they are not up-to-date, nor translated entirely.<br>

= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Role Counts/Amounts are not remotely close to correct, if someone would like to do the math because Pyro is lazy, PLEASE DO! :D thanks!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: If there are any other issues, open a forum in #website-feedback! Thank you! - Pyro<br>
