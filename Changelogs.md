= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Updated to v2.0.0 Canary 11.1<br>
\+ Have a good day!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: If there are any other issues, open a forum in `#website-feedback`! Thank you!<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: `Tracker`, `Noisemaker`, and `Phantom` have been added to the Vanilla Tab of their respective factions.<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: `Tracker (TOHE)` has been REMOVED.<br>
\+ <font color=#12edaf><b>RENAMED</b></font>: `Phantom (TOHE)` has been renamed to `Specter`.<br>
\+ <font color=#12edaf><b>RENAMED</b></font>: `Schizophrenic` has been renamed to `Paranoia`.<br>
\+ <font color=#12edaf><b>RENAMED</b></font>: `Masochist` has been renamed to `Punching Bag`.<br>

\+ <font color=#12edaf><b>RENAMED</b></font>: `GetStarted.md` has been renamed to `Install.md`<br>

\+ <font color=#12edaf><b>RENAMED</b></font>: `Custom.md` has been renamed to `Game.md`<br>
\+ <font color=#12edaf><b>RENAMED</b></font>: `vote.md` has been capitalized to `Vote.md`.<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Added `Other` as a Tab for Add-ons as it's nicer to keep all addons in the same group (I'm not adding them to Game Modifiers, that's ugly).<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Resources.md` (Includes more Resources to look through, such as Commands/HotKeys like before, as well as Death Reasons + why they occur, and more.)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `FAQ.md` (Questions are now sorted in drop-down boxes.)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Install.md` (Now includes both Steam + Epic guides, and has been straightened up.)<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Changelogs.md`. (Now includes "KNOWN BUGS")<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Redid the layout of `Changelogs.md` again. (Now utilizes Dropdown boxes as to not clutter the page, allowing for people to look at the changelogs they care about.)<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: Relating to the above changes, `Stable.md`, `Canary.md`, & `Dev.md` will be overhauled to utilize dropdown boxes too, but thats a lot more work.<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Fixing Spacing (hopefully) for `FAQ.md`, as well as `Install.md` & `Resources.md`.<br>
= <font color=#e08709><b>IMPROVEMENT</b></font>: Increased the text size (hopefully) for `FAQ.md`, as well as `Install.md`, `Resources.md`, `Changelogs.md` (`Dev.md`, `Canary.md`, & `Stable.md`), & `Presets.md`.<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Added `Presets.md` (Instead of cluttering `Resources.md` with future Preset Submissions, Presets will be listed here. Added Marg's Preset & removed 2 out of date Presets (WitchCraft & Moe's Presets which used the old system).<br>
= <font color=#F6BE00><b>CHANGE</b></font>: More Bios added to `AboutUs.md`. (Still not 100% Complete as we are still missing the Bios of a few Contributors. You can see which as they'll have `(Placeholder Bio)` in the place of their Bio.<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: Role Counts/Amounts are finally corrected, thanks Drakos for doing the numbers! No idea what `[None] = Count: 13` still means though.<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: There were a lot of new Settings added to the mod + settings added to some roles, which are not live on site yet. That's a lot of work, and I'm not going to do it right now!<br>
= <font color=#1376f0><b>BUG FIXES</b></font>: Many formatting, linking, and spelling fixes/updates.<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: `zh-CN` and `fr` are fully up-to-date with Main (en-US), but not translated, meaning Simplified Chinese & French Translations are still in the works, sorry!<br>
= <font color=#fdf08e><b>NOTE</b></font>: You may realize that there are 3 results of roles if you use the built-in search bar. This is because you are getting a copy for every instance (Currently, `fr` & `zh-CN`) that is not yet translated. (An example being Reverie, even though <i>most</i> roles will display 3 results.)<br>
