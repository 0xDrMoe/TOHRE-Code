## Member Submitted Presets

You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. 

For Instructions on how to Install Presets, visit the bottom of [This Page](/Install.html).

Keep in Mind: It is always suggested to just roll with whatever you like! If you see any roles you may like or are simply interested in, enable them, and mess with them to your personal liking!

You can submit your own preset to be featured by joining the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ten), heading to #website-feedback, and creating a forum post with the Preset tag.
