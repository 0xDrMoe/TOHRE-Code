<b>We've received a definitive update from the developers at Innersloth regarding the Rate Limit anti-cheat measures.<br>
Innersloth has decided to temporarily relax these measures, with plans to reinstate them on April 4th. This will give modders ample time to adapt to the changes in the anti-cheat strategy. We're actively working with the team to ensure a smooth transition.<br>
During this period, we'll be rolling out several test builds to assess the situation and prepare for the eventual reactivation of the anti-cheat measures.<br>
Please keep in mind that, due to the limitations of the game protocol, we cannot guarantee a fully stable experience on official servers once the Rate Limit anti-cheat measures are reinstated.<br>
Innersloth recommends that modders who cannot adapt to these changes consider moving to Modded Regions. These regions may offer a more consistent and stable experience than the official servers, making them an ideal alternative for many players.<br>
When playing on InnerSloth official servers, please be aware that the Rate Limit anti-cheat system may cause compatibility issues with most mods, leading to unexpected in-game problems that wouldn't occur on modded regions. There's also a small chance the anti-cheat system could flag you.<br>
If you experience any of these issues, feel free to submit a bug report through our Discord, and we'll do our best to resolve it.<br>
Once Innersloth reactivates its Rate Limit anti-cheat, Rate Limit Bypasses will be automatically enforced.<br>
Remember, this may cause unexpected issues on official servers, such as unhidden messages from guessers, delayed player name updates, packet loss resulting in missed updates, occasional black screens after meetings, and very slow loading times. If you continue to play with this option enabled, please be aware that the server may become unstable, and there is a slight chance of being flagged by the anti-cheat system. We will do our best to address these issues, but please understand that some may be beyond our control.</b><br>

Important changes by [TommyXL](https://github.com/Tommy-XL) and [Niko](https://github.com/NikoCat233)<br>
You may experience slower loading times on official servers, missing chat messages, delayed player name updates, and occasional role assignment issues. For the best gaming experience, we recommend playing on modded regions like Niko's or Modded.<br>
We've added an option to toggle Rate Limit Bypasses on or off in System Settings at the top.<br>
By default, it’s enabled and will only work on official servers. Since Innersloth has temporarily eased its Rate Limit anti-cheat, you can safely disable it for a more stable experience on official servers. However, we’d greatly appreciate it if you could enable it and help us test its functionality.<br>

<b>Update on Mod Progress & How You Can Help</b><br>

<i>Our mod updates are moving slower than we'd like because our small team has limited time to work on coding. Our top priority is keeping the mod stable and fixing any bugs so everyone can enjoy it without issues.</i><br>

<i>Volunteers from our community added new roles, features, and improvements, and we thank everyone who contributed! Please remember that these updates often take longer because they rely on volunteers' free time.</i><br>

<i>Want to help speed things up? We'd love to welcome new contributors! Whether you're comfortable polishing existing code, designing characters, or suggesting creative ideas, your help can make a big difference. No matter your skill level, there's room for you to join in and shape the mod's future.</i><br>

<i>We're grateful for your patience and support. Let's keep making this mod even better—together!</i><br>
