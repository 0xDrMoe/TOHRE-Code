## About the Developers

I like coding for fun, and started off modifying Town of Host: The Other Roles. Released it a few months later under the name "Town of Host Plus".

Then I discovered Town of Host Edited, and moved on to it. Then I decided to modify that as well when I was bored. Many roles in TOHE now (such as Poisoner and Marshall) were from that stage. 

Then came the day Karpe decided to discontinue TOHE and quit the modding, to where I stepped in to continue the man's work and keep the mod's glory alive.

Thus, Town of Host-ReEdited was born.

I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in High School, and I've been coding for 6 years. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French and Arabic verbally! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship, but I stumbled upon TOHE and I loved it. I decided to help out with the mod, and I'm currently the website developer. 

I specialize in HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python and C++. I graduated from College with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, fousing on Cybersecurity. and I'm working towards that goal.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the mod, and I hope to see you on Discord!
