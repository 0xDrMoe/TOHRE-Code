## About the Developers

I like coding for fun, and started off modifying Town of Host: The Other Roles. Released it a few months later under the name "Town of Host Plus".

Then I discovered Town of Host Edited, and moved on to it. Then I decided to modify that as well when I was bored. Many roles in TOHE now (such as Poisoner and Marshall) were from that stage. 

Then came the day Karpe decided to discontinue TOHE and quit the modding, to where I stepped in to continue the man's work and keep the mod's glory alive.

Thus, Town of Host Edited: Restored was born.
