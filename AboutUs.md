## About the Project Lead/Website Developer

I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in High School, and I've been coding for 6 years. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French and Arabic verbally! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship, but I stumbled upon TOHE and I loved it. I decided to help out with the mod, and I'm currently the website developer. 

I specialize in HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python and C++. I graduated from College with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, fousing on Cybersecurity. and I'm working towards that goal.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the mod, and I hope to see you on Discord!
