## Translations

You can create your own translations that TOHE/Among Us don't already support, and use them if you wish. You can also download custom translations shared by others. If you want to use a translation, make sure the file is renamed to `English.dat` before using if, it isn't already. (If you do not have `File name extensions` marked on the `View` Tab, you only need to rename it to `Options`.)

Note: You have to put the file in the following directory: `.\Among Us\Language` for it to work. (Make sure your file is a `.dat` file, otherwise it will not work. Paste it alongside the `template.dat` file already in your folder.)

You can submit your own translation to be featured by joining the [TOHE Discord](https://discord.gg/TOHE), heading to #website-feedback, and creating a forum post with the Translation tag.
Below are some member submitted translations:
