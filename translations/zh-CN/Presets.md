## Presets

You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. If you want to use a preset, make sure the file is renamed to `Options.json` before using it, if it isn't already. (If you do not have `File name extensions` marked on the `View` Tab, you only need to rename it to `Options`.)

Note: You have to put the file in the following directory: `.\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData` for it to work. (If you cannot locate `TOHE-DATA\SaveData`, try enabling `Hidden items` on the `View` Tab!)

You can submit your own preset to be featured by joining the [TOHE Discord](https://discord.gg/TOHE), heading to #website-feedback, and creating a forum post with the Preset tag.
Below are some member submitted presets:
