Once the Soul Collector has collected their needed souls, they become Death. Death kills everyone and wins if Death is not ejected by the end of the next meeting.<br>
A configurable amount of extra meeting time wi be given on the meeting Death transforms to have more discussion to find Death.<br>
<b>You are invincible and your presence is announced to everyone at the meeting after you transform.</b>
