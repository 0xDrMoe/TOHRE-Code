<summary><b><font color=gray>TOHE-DATA Info</font></b></summary>

Open the root directory of game: `...\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\`

There are a few files:

- `BanList.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will be unable to join your lobby.

- `Default_Teamplate.txt`: This is the Default TOHE Template file. If you wish to reset your templates to default, You can use this. (No idea why it says Teamplate.)

- `DenyName.txt`: A list of names that will be filtered out of the game.

- `Moderators.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will receive a nice Moderator tag (editable via `...\Among Us\Language\english.dat`) as well as permissions to moderate your lobby (such as using the commands near the top of the page). Only grant users you trust these permissions!

- `template.txt`: You can modify the `welcome` and `onMeeting` messages here. You can also add custom templates here as well following the same format as `welcome` & `onMeeting` use.

- `VIP-List.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will be given a sweet VIP tag (editable via `...\Among Us\Language\english.dat`) as well as permissions to change their name color.

- `WhiteList.txt`: A list of friendcodes that will be exempt from blacklisted platforms, along with level requirements.

<summary><b><font color=gray>Templates Info</font></b></summary>

Open the root directory of the mod and find the `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\template.txt` file.

You can see that there are some words in the file, such as `welcome`, `onMeeting`, and other gibberish.
- `welcome:exampleMessage` - this is the message that will be sent when other players enter your lobby.
- `onMeeting:exampleMessage` - this is the message that will be sent when each meeting starts. 
- `onFirstMeeting:exampleMessage` - this is just like `onMeeting`, but the message sent here will only be sent on the <i>first</i> meeting. Any meetings after will prioritize `onMeeting`. 

You can edit these templates, or add your own on new-lines!

On a new-line, you want to add your trigger word and your message. Such as: `[example]:this is an example template!` <i>(The trigger word being `[example]` and the message being `this is an example template!`. (YOU NEED THE `:`!))</i> You can add as many of these as you want. You can then save the file, boot up the mod, and run `/t [example]` in your chat box to see if it's set up to your liking!

Alternatively, you may also use this [Template Editor](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/editor.html) put together by one of TOHE's Contributors, [Drakos](https://github.com/Ultradragon005).
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>Guide</font></b></summary>

There is a Tutorial at the bottom of the Template Editior's page if you need it. If you do not want to watch it, here's a small guide abounht how to use it.

1. Enter a Title for the template. This title will be displayed at the top of the template when its activated in game. Here's what the title will look like by default:
![image](./images/TemplateTitle.png)
2. Enter in what you want the template to display. You can edit the Font Size & Text Colors, but it is recommended to do it last. (From: Drakos)
3. Enter in the name for this template. This name will also be the trigger word for this template. `[example]:this is an example template!` (`[example]` being the name/trigger word)
4. Click the "Copy as HTML Formatted" to copy your template to your clipboard.
5. Locate `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\template.txt` and paste your new template on a new-line.
6. You can then save the file [`[Ctrl] + [S]`], boot up the mod, and run `/t [example]` in your chat box to see if it's set up to your liking!
</details>

If you create copies of the template name on newlines, it will send them in seperate messages. Here's an example from Drakos:
