# TOHE-DATA Info

Open the root directory of game: `...\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\`

There are a few files:

- BanList.txt: A list of friendcodes that will be unable to join your lobby.
- Default_Teamplate.txt: This will pull from `template.txt` and is used in game. Think of this as the final product used in-game, and `template.txt` as the rough draft.
- DenyName.txt: A list of names that will be filtered out in the game.
- Moderators.txt: A list of friendcodes that will be given more permissions to moderate your lobby (such as /kick). Only grant users you trust these permissions!
- template.txt: You can modify the `welcome` and `onMeeting` messages here. You can also add custom templates here as well following the same format as `welcome` & `onMeeting` use.
- VIP-List.txt: A list of friendcodes that will be given a sweet VIP tag (editable via `...\Among Us\Language\english.dat`) as well as permissions to change their name color.
- WhiteList.txt: A list of friendcodes that will be exempt from blacklisted platforms, along with level requirements.

## Presets

You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. If you want to use a preset, make sure the file is renamed to `Options.json` before using if, it isn't already. (If you do not have `File name extensions` marked on the `View` Tab, you only need to rename it to `Options`.)

Note: You have to put the file in the following directory: `.\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData` for it to work. (If you cannot locate `TOHE-DATA\SaveData`, try enabling `Hidden items` on the `View` Tab!)

For some member submitted presets, browse [here](/Presets.html)

## Templates

Open the root directory of the mod and find the `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\template.txt` file.

You can see that there are some words in the file, such as `welcome`, `onMeeting`, and other gibberish.
- `welcome:exampleMessage` - this is the message that will be sent when other players enter your lobby.
- `onMeeting:exampleMessage` - this is the message that will be sent when each meeting starts. 
- `onFirstMeeting:exampleMessage` - this is just like `onMeeting`, but the message sent here will only be sent on the <i>first</i> meeting. Any meetings after will prioritize `onMeeting`. 

You can edit these templates, or add your own on new-lines!

On a new-line, you want to add your trigger word and your message. Such as: `[example]:this is an example template!` <i>(The trigger word being `[example]` and the message being `this is an example template!`. (YOU NEED THE `:`!))</i> You can add as many of these as you want. You can then save the file, boot up the mod, and run `/t [example]` in your chat box to see if it's set up to your liking!

Alternatively, you may also use this [Template Editor](https://ultradragon005.github.io/AmongUs-Utilities/editor.html) put together by one of TOHE's Contributors, [Drakos](https://github.com/Ultradragon005).
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>Guide</font></b></summary>

There is a Tutorial at the bottom of the Template Editior's page if you need it. If you do not want to watch it, here's a small guide abounht how to use it.

1. Enter a Title for the template. This title will be displayed at the top of the template when its activated in game. Here's what the title will look like by default:
![image](./images/TemplateTitle.png)
2. Enter in what you want the template to display. You can edit the Font Size & Text Colors, but it is recommended to do it last. (From: Drakos)
3. Enter in the name for this template. This name will also be the trigger word for this template. `[example]:this is an example template!` (`[example]` being the name/trigger word)
4. Click the "Copy as HTML Formatted" to copy your template to your clipboard.
5. Locate `..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\template.txt` and paste your new template on a new-line.
6. You can then save the file [`[Ctrl] + [S]`], boot up the mod, and run `/t [example]` in your chat box to see if it's set up to your liking!
</details>

If you create copies of the template name on newlines, it will send them in seperate messages. Check out this example from Drakos for an example:
